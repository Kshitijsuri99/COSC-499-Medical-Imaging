Daniil
	Pros
		He has major contributions to our group project and works hard to get on top of the questions we may have for our client
		Before our group meeting, we had some miscommunication which caused a conflict, which is now resolved!
		He is knowledgable about our project and goes out of his way to search for various alternative solutions to our problems which is amazing.
	Cons
		Sometimes does too much work leaving us with less to do, or eats into our specific roles <- this has been resolved.
