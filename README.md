To understand the project better please take a look at the DesignDocument folder and Read the high level section.


You can also view the DFD folder to see the data flow diagrams. The flowcharts explain the dataflow of the mammograph and patient information from the Patient to the user who is trying to retrieve the information.
The Level 0 flowchart gives a general understanding whereas in Level 1 we get a more detailed understading of all the steps involved in the dataflow.
