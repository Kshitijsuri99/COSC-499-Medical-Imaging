To understand the project better please take a look at the "Initial Understanding Flowcharts" Folder:
The flowcharts explain the dataflow of the mammograph and patient information from the Patient to the user who is trying to retrieve the information.
The Level 0 flowchart gives a general understanding whereas in Level 1 we get a more detailed understading of all the steps involved in the dataflow.
