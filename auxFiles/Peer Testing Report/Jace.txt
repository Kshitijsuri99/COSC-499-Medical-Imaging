Peer Testing Project Report

Explain how the images worked
A DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file is a protocol that contains a header and image data packet into a single file. The way the information is stored within the header, it is organized as a standardized series of tags. These tags contain information regarding the patient such as demographics, research parameters etc.

Verified the integrity of the images.
In order for the pipeline to work correctly, the un-anonymized portions of data must match the data of the original DICOM file. It is important that the file’s integrity is not compromised during the pipeline’s process.

What part of the system is more dangerous
The possible dangers behind our system are the possible security flaws that might arise with our anonymization pipeline. The safety, security, and anonymity of patients' data are extremely crucial and must be protected as much as possible.

Mention activities that we did during the week
Final report
Group meeting on Thursday to discuss future plans, implementations, and ideas. 
Tested that files worked by uploading them onto a DICOM reader.


Add more unit tests
There are several unit tests that we must continue to add such as checking the anonymity of data, as well as correctness of data compared to the original un-anonymized DICOM file. These will be one of the first implementations for unit tests, since they are crucial to the integrity of the files. 

Issues discovered during tests 
Insecure setup
Solutions to Issues
The Orthanc server accepted remote connections but used the default username and password. The issue was fixed by simply first registering an administrator account, and then removing access of the default user. Although, this issue is not a big one since the setup will be done by the client once the software has been completed.
