Automation is a core principle for achieving DevOps success and CI/CD is a critical component. CI/CD comprises of continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment. Put together, they form a “CI/CD pipeline”—a series of automated workflows that help DevOps teams cut down on manual tasks:

Continuous integration (CI) automatically builds, tests, and integrates code changes within a shared repository; then
Continuous delivery (CD) automatically delivers code changes to production-ready environments for approval; or
Continuous deployment (CD) automatically deploys code changes to customers directly.

Why CI/CD?
The short answer: Speed. The State of DevOps report found organizations that have “mastered” CI/CD deploy 208 times more often and have a lead time that is 106 times faster than the rest. While faster development is the most well-known benefit of CI/CD, a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline enables much more.

Development velocity
Ongoing feedback allows developers to commit smaller changes more often, versus waiting for one release.

Stability and reliability
Automated, continuous testing ensures that codebases remain stable and release-ready at any time.

Business growth
Freed up from manual tasks, organizations can focus resources on innovation, customer satisfaction, and paying down technical debt.
